## COVID-19 Dashboard Development Using React.js

# The solution for building a COVID-19 dashboard in React.js involves the following key steps

# API Integration:

Historical COVID-19 Data API: Integrated an API to fetch COVID-19 historical data for the default country (USA) and allowed users to switch between countries using a dropdown. The API endpoint https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/historical/{country}?lastdays=1500 was used, where {country} is replaced with the ISO code of the selected country.
Country List API: Implemented a second API to populate the dropdown with country options. The endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all provided a list of countries and their codes for dropdown selection.
Core Features Implemented:

React Components: Developed statistical cards, a line chart, and a pie chart for data visualization.
State Management: Used React's state management capabilities to maintain and update the state effectively.
Responsiveness: Ensured the application worked seamlessly on various screen sizes.
Error Handling: Implemented error handling mechanisms for all API requests to improve reliability.
Development Practices:

Clean Code: Wrote clean, modular, and well-documented code for better readability and maintenance.
Styling: Styled the application in alignment with the provided mockup to ensure consistency.
Version Control: Managed the project using Git and provided a GitHub repository containing the source code.
Documentation: Included a README.md file with detailed setup instructions for ease of project installation and usage.
Optional Deliverable:

Provided an option for a live demo of the application for better evaluation.
Evaluation Focus:

Adherence to the provided mockup and functional requirements.
Code quality and structure.
Responsiveness and cross-device usability.
Overall performance and efficiency of the application.

# Asynchronous Data Fetching: I refactored the data fetching to use async/await for better readability.
# State Management: The state is managed cleanly using useState for various app states (country, data, error, loading).
# Error Handling: Error messages are displayed in a consistent manner using conditional rendering.
# Responsive Design: Minor changes in the CSS (like max-width for charts) ensure better responsiveness across different screen sizes.
# Component Structure: The code is modular and easy to maintain, with each feature (country dropdown, stats cards, and line chart) placed in separate components.
# CSS Styling: The styling is improved for clarity and visual appeal (such as adding margins, padding, and a cleaner layout).
